# StealthyWhisper
Stealthy Whisper is a ciphering tool that hides a message in another message as invisble characters.

## Features

- **Encryption:**
- **Stealthy Whisper employs substitution to turn your input text into a seemingly innocent string with concealed information.

## How it works

1. Input your desired text to be encrypted.
2. Stealthy Whisper applies its proprietary encoding technique to hide the text within invisible characters.
3. The encrypted string is generated and ready for use.
4. Decryption is possible only if you use the correct decryption method and key.
